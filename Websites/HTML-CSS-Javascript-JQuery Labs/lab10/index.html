        <h3>CIS 275 - Web Application Programming 1</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                An introduction to the languages used to develop web applications with focus on client-side technologies. Topics include, but are not limited to, web programming practices, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks to support client-side web development.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>CIS 332 - Structured Sys Analysis/Design</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The study of the Systems Development Life Cycle is stressed, including strategies and techniques of structured analysis, planning and design, testing, and implementation. Case studies will be used along with hands-on application of concepts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>CSC 260 - Object Oriented Design</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                This course emphasizes object-oriented programming methodologies. An object-oriented language will be used to illustrate these OO concepts. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) will be introduced.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>CSC 314 - Assembly Language</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                A thorough introduction to assembly language programming and processor architecture. A study of low-level programming techniques, and the layout of a typical computer. The student will gain insight into the memory layout, registers run-time stack, and global data segment of a running program.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>CSC 300 - Data Structures</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                A systematic study of data structures and the accompanying algorithms used in computing problems; structure and use of storage; methods of representing data; techniques for implementing data structures; linear lists; stacks; queue; trees and tree traversal; linked lists; and other structures.
