            <h3>Dark Souls</h3>
            <p>
                Dark Souls is the first game in the of the Dark Souls Trilogy. While it had problems such as it's pc port Dark Souls is one of the best games ever made. Its gritty story and sad narratives
                kept players interested throughout the game. Characters dark pasts and evil tendencies matched the story's somber nature.

            <p>
                The second game in the Dark Souls series was less liked by many. Players complained of clunky combat and compared the game to the much better-looking trailers, and while the game did look worse than 
                what was shown Dark Souls 2 is one of the best games ever made. While at first, the combat seems slow and boring once you get the hang of it you will begin to like it. The methodical pace of the game's
                combat lends itself to the slow nature of the story.
            </p>
            <h3>Dark Souls 3</h3>
            <p>
                Dark Souls 3 is more of a continuation of the first game than a successor to the second. It's fast-paced combat and graphics lead it to be the most popular of the Souls games, and while it didn't have
                some of the greatness of the first or second game this allowed it to be one of the most played games ever.
