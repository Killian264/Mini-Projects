    <h2>Here are some of the best games that I have played.</h2>
    <p>
        I plan to keep a group of some of the best video games on this website. I would keep games like Dark Souls here, the best game I have played and one of the best games ever made.
        I will have a list below showing off my favorite video games. Each of these games will have a link to it's Steam page where you can buy the game or check it out.

    <h3>I really like Dark Souls</h3>
    <p>
        The Dark Souls series is one of the best video game series ever made. The gameplay is unmatched even among its clones and spinoffs.
        Mysterious and dark its gritty nature lends to the atmosphere of the games and the feeling of existential dread.
        I love <b>Dark Souls</b>.
